# Lectures notes for Functional Programming Principles in Scala by Martin Odersky

- Rating: 5/5
- Summary: This course changed how I code (even when I'm using languages that are not Scala). It opened my mind to a new way of thinking, where functions are central to all code I write. The results of this was that my code became much more readable than before. By the end of this course, I was using higher-order functions in my daily work.
